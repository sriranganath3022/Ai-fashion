NOTE: This repository is an extremely hacky modification of [RoomGPT](https://github.com/Nutlope/roomGPT).

## What does it do?
- takes an image (from you)
- finds a clothing mask (super accurate modification of SAM)
- calls stable diffusion inpainting
- BAM!
- try the API on [Replicate](https://replicate.com/naklecha/fashion-ai) (they gave me a bunch of credits for this project, i am extremely grateful for them <3)

## What else could you do?
- Try out [roomgpt.io](roomgpt.io), its much cooler than fashionAI + Hassan got 1 million users which is wild!
- [Hassan](https://twitter.com/nutlope) did most of the hard work for this amazing frontend. 
- All I did was edit it a lil (with terrible commit messages) :c
- I did create the API on [Replicate](https://replicate.com/naklecha/fashion-ai) tho ðŸ˜Ž
